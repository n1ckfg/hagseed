He required a focus, a purpose. He gave this much thought while sitting in his deck chair. Eventually he concluded that there were two things thing left for him - two projects that could still hold satisfaction. After a time he began to see more clearly what they were.
First, he needed to get his Tempest back. He had to stage it, somehow, somewhere. His reasons were beyond theatrical; they had nothing to do with his reputation, his career - none of that. Quite simply, his Miranda must be released from her glass co n; she must be given a life. But how to do it, where to find the actors? Actors did not grow on trees, numerous though the trees were around his hovel.
Second, he wanted revenge. He longed for it. He day- dreamed about it. Tony and Sal must su er. His present woeful situation was their doing, or a lot of it was. They?d treated him shabbily. But what form could such revenge possibly take?
Those were the two things he wanted. He wanted them more each day. But he didnâ€™t know how to go about getting them.
